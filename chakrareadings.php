<h3>What's a Chakra?</h3>
<p>Chakra is a Sanskrit word meaning wheel, or vortex, and it refers to  each of the seven energy centers of which our consciousness, our energy  system, is composed.</p>

<p>These  chakras, or energy centers, function as pumps or valves, regulating the  flow of energy through our energy system. The functioning of the  chakras reflects decisions we make concerning how we choose to respond  to conditions in our life. We open and close these valves when we  decide what to think, and what to feel, and through which perceptual  filter we choose to experience the world around us.</p>
<p>The chakras are not physical. They are aspects of consciousness in  the same way that the auras are aspects of consciousness. The chakras  are more dense than the auras, but not as dense as the physical body.
  They interact with the physical body through two major vehicles, the endocrine system and the nervous system.
  Each of the seven chakras is associated with one of the seven endocrine  glands, and also with a group of nerves called a plexus. Thus, each  chakra can be associated with particular parts of the body and  particular functions within the body controlled by that plexus or that  endocrine gland associated with that chakra.</p> <img src="images/Chakra-Yellow.jpg" alt="3" width="242" height="300" class="mediumpic right">
<p>All of your senses, all of your perceptions, all of your possible  states of awareness, everything it is possible for you to experience,  can be divided into seven categories. Each category can be associated  with a particular chakra. Thus, the chakras represent not only  particular parts of your physical body, but also particular parts of  your consciousness.</p>
