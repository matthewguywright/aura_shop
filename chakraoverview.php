<h2>Chakra Overview</h2>
<p>Creating our personal Aura     Colors, we have seven individual Chakras in our body. These centers reflect     our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual energy. Many people can naturally     see the colors around our body, as well as the individual colors within our     chakra areas. Depending on the clarity of the colors, we can tell how balanced     and how healthy we are. Most disease stems from emotional issues relating to     one or two chakras. By determining these, we can begin to heal the emotional     trauma that ultimately caused our disease or discomfort in a particular area     of our body. </p>
<p>The following chart     gives you an overview of your Chakras:</p>
