
<h2>The Aura</h2>
        
        <div><p>Your body has seven major energy centers called Chakras. These vortex-like centers vibrate at different speeds and frequencies translating into color and sound, from red in the base of your spine through all the colors of the rainbow, to violet on the top of your head. We are all mini rainbows! That's why we love color so much.</p>

<p>When these seven chakras are all balanced, we are the happiest. When our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual energies are in harmony we have unlimited abundance and become joyful co-creators of our lives.</p> </div>
<h2>Your Aura Colors</h2>
                <p>Every living being is surrounded by an electromagnetic energy field  called an Aura. This field vibrates at different frequencies and  reflects your state of Mind, Body and Inner Being. 
              
                Each color of your Aura has a different Vibrational Frequency and is  associated with seven major chakras, or energy centers, in your body.  The colors of your Aura reflect your Physical, Mental, Emotional and  Spiritual energy. Each color has a unique virbration, providing us with  insight and guidance to facilitate change and transformation, both  inside and outside of us.</p>
