
<h2>The Aura</h2>
        
        <div><p>Your body has seven major energy centers called Chakras. These vortex-like centers vibrate at different speeds and frequencies translating into color and sound, from red in the base of your spine through all the colors of the rainbow, to violet on the top of your head. We are all mini rainbows! That's why we love color so much.</p>

<p>When these seven chakras are all balanced, we are the happiest. When our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual energies are in harmony we have unlimited abundance and become joyful co-creators of our lives.</p> </div>
